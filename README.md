## Description
- The Shunt Algorithm
Developed by Edsger Dijkstra The Shunting Yard Algorithm 
changes an infix notation to a postfix notation using a stack
to hold operators.
The purpose of the stack is to reverse the order of the 
operators in the expression.

- Thompsons Construction
Thompsons Construction is a method of transforming regular expressions into 
nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA). 
This NFA can be used to match strings against the regular expression.
